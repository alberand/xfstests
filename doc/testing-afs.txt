				 ===========

xfstests can be used with the Linux kernel AFS filesystem (kafs).  kafs mounts
each volume as a separate volume and, as such, allows them to be individually
mounted on arbitrary paths.  This allows xfstests to be easily configured to
use specific volumes.  This doesn't work with OpenAFS, say, as that operates
with everything in a single superblock.

xfstests requires that the volumes specified by forced to use RW volumes by
prefixing the mount device with '%' rather than '#' as per the format of a
mountpoint string:

	%<volume>

using the workstation cell, or:

	%<cell>:<volume>

using an explicit cell.

For example:

	FSTYP=afs
	TEST_DEV=%example.com:xfstest.test
	TEST_DIR=/mnt/xfstest.test
	SCRATCH_DEV=%example.com:xfstest.scratch
	SCRATCH_MNT=/mnt/xfstest.scratch

will use the xfstest.test and xfstest.scratch volumes located in the
example.com cell.


Note that AFS in general and kafs in particular lack a number of features that
can be tested for and so a lot of tests will be skipped.
